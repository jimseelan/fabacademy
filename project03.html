        <h2>Final Project - Steps</h2>
        
        <p>I splited the final project in to two main phases. The first one is the physical design and fabrication; and the second one the electronics part. </p>
        
        <h3>Designing the FabWheel</h3>
        
        <p>As the main work is centered on the robustness of the physical prototype the lions share of the time went into the physical design phase. I used NX as the design tool, and started with a layout initially. This layout is created in the sketch module parametrically, so that I could iterate the design as required.</p>
        
        <p> <img src="images/project/sk1.jpg" width=80% height=auto>
       <p><legend>The layout for finalizing the overall dimensions. This was the starting point of the design where all the overall sizes and shapes where decided. </legend></p>
        
        <p> <img src="images/project/sk3.jpg" width=80% height=auto>  </p> </p>       
       <p><legend>The first shape of the base support which was rounded. </legend></p>        

        <p> <img src="images/project/sk2.jpg" width=80% height=auto>  </p> </p>       
       <p><legend>The revised shape of the base support which was more pointed. </legend></p>
        
        <p> <img src="images/project/SK4.jpg" width=80% height=auto>  </p> </p>       
       <p><legend>The final 2D layout with the sizes and shapes fixed. </legend></p>
        
        <p>Once The layout was a finalized, I proceeded to create the individual components, starting with the base support parts</p>
        
        <p> <img src="images/project/side_support.jpg" width=80% height=auto>  </p>       
       <p><legend>The design of the side support, 2x of these were made. </legend></p>        
        
        <p> <img src="images/project/wheel_support_bottom.jpg" width=80% height=auto>  </p>       
       <p><legend>The design of the wheel support bottom part, 2x of these were made. </legend></p>                
        <p> <img src="images/project/wheel_support_top.jpg" width=80% height=auto>  </p>       
       <p><legend>The design of the wheel support top part, 2x of these were made. </legend></p>

       <p><legend>The Assembly of the wheel support parts, showing a representation of wheel also. </legend></p>   
        
        <p> <img src="images/project/end_lateral.jpg" width=80% height=auto>  </p>       
       <p><legend>End lateral supports were also added to mount the elctronics and toput a wheel lock when not in use. </legend></p>   


        <p>Once these parts are made and assembled, then the rings for the slats were made. These rings were made in two parts for want of strength. The inner diameter is made to 2meters, so that it could fit someone bit taller than me. Considering the fit to the standard size plwoods of 8ft x 4ft, each rings were made in 3 parts of 120-deg included angle. Dovetail joints were used to join these. The inner rings also had the teeth to pressfit the slats. There are 51 slats which contituted the walking surface. The various design aspects of these parts are illustrtaed in the images below. </p>

<h3>Fabricating the FabWheel</h3>

<p>The DXF files where exported to and taken to the Shopbot's VCarve software to generate the NC code and cut using the Shopbot. The DXF files used for cutting is available in the files section and the screenshots of those are given below for ready reference.I have used 5 sheets of 19mm plywood and 2 sheets of 20mm plywood. Only the project speific things are discussed here and the documentation of shopbot is available in my <a href="exercise07.html">Computer Controlled Machining Week Assignment.</a></p>

       <p><legend>The Inner rings are cut using this DXF. Two of these sheet is required to make the 6 pieces for both sides. Also note the features provided for pressfit and the test cut piece. I have done these parts on 20mm plywood, but this could also be done on the 1mm plywood as the others. </legend></p>

        <p> <img src="images/project/cut_slats.jpg" width=90% height=auto>  </p>       
       <p><legend>To reduce cutting time a separate cutting drawing is created for the slats. </legend></p>

       <p><legend>The fasteners are tightened again after making the rings stand. and these steps are also repeated for the other set of rings. Do note that these assembly steps require atleast 4 people considering the weight and size of the parts.</legend></p>

        <p> <img src="images/project/mfg/support_wheel.jpg" width=90% height=auto>  </p>       
       <p><legend>The support wheels are then mounted using 1/2" bolts and nuts. As the rings used to rub against the base support ply there was huge friction. Tried many options like inclining the wheels so that the rings are more centered (by rasing the sides of the wheels by adding 2 pieces of 3mm plywood as shown above) (these was later removed). But finally the solution of adding ball castors on the base side ply solved the issue, and its shown in the image below.  </legend></p>

<h3>Electronics Design</h3>
    <p>On the electronics part, I wanted to sense the number of rotations and get it displayed on a mobile device.</p> <br>

       <p><legend>The board layout created using Autodesk Eagle </legend></p>

        <p>For the sensing the rotations, I thought to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_switch">Reed Switch</a>, and ordered one like <a href="http://www.amazon.in/3-3V-5V-Magnetic-Photocopiers-machines-Refrigerators/dp/B018VQ2H1E">this</a>.</p> <br>

        <p>For the Bluetooth part I planned to use the <a href="http://www.amazon.in/Bluetooth-Transceiver-Module-TTL-Outputs-HC05/dp/B00R95Y0AK">HC-05 bluetooth module.</a></p>

        <p>On the controller part, I used the ATmega328P and based my design on the <a href="https://github.com/satshas/satshakit">satshakit micro</a>. The micro design was very compact for my application, and was compactly routed. I also added a regulated power input circuit, so that a 9V battery could be used in the circuit. The eagle schematics and board files are shown in the images. Please find the list of components in the BOM attached towards the end of this page.  </p>

       <p><legend>Testing the board with the reed sensor and the bluetooth module. later the connections are made directly to the components while put into the electronic housing discussed below.</legend></p>

<h3>Electronic Housing</h3>

<p>I wanted the electronic housing to be a fastener free design permiting distance adjustment with the magnet. I have provisioned a lateral member in the base design to mount these and any other attachments as required. The electronic housing also wnt through multiple iterations before finalised on the design that is 3D printed.</p>

       <p><legend>The electronic housing could be assembled by inserting to the end laterals provided in the base assembly. This housing is also movable laterally. No fasteners were used, still it gave a good fit. Anyway I have put some holes for any one wanting a more robust attachment which may fix its position after alignment with the magnets.</legend></p>

<h3>Companion App for FabWheel</h3>
<p>MIT's Appinventor is used to create the companion app for the fabwheel. My plan was to display the number of rotations of the fabwheel in the app. </p>

        <p> <img src="images/project/appinventor_blocks.jpg" width=90% height=auto>  </p>       
       <p><legend>The logic was to get the number of rotation displayed. Blocks for bluetooth connectivity was used. Also a red line is made for progress in the energy canvas. The main trigger was the clock object that gets and displays the data.</legend></p>

<h3>Conclusion and future plans</h3>
<p>This project has enabled me to showcase the various skills learned and practiced duirng the fabacademy course, and I was very happy when everybody had fun walking on the fabwheel, and it was a crowd puller and curiosity generator during many of the group visits in our fablab. I plan to take this to my work place and gradually later continue to add more module including a small power generator, RGB light strips, integration to computer games, gamified leaderbords etc. </p>
